Estimated Calculation for Cool Port II
For a facility of Cool Port II's size (60,000 pallet capacity):

Facility Size Estimation:

A typical pallet space requires about 4-6 cubic meters of cold storage
60,000 pallets × 5 m³ = approximately 300,000 m³ facility volume


Energy Consumption:

Using the 10 kWh/m³/year standard for modern efficient facilities
300,000 m³ × 10 kWh/m³/year = 3,000,000 kWh/year
3,000,000 kWh/year ÷ 365 days = approximately 8,219 kWh/day
8,219 kWh/day ÷ 24 hours = approximately 342 kW average continuous load


Emergency Backup Power Sizing:

Accounting for starting power requirements (4× running watts)
342 kW × 4 = 1,368 kW starting capacity needed
Adding 25% reserve capacity for additional safety margin
1,368 kW × 1.25 = 1,710 kW minimum generator capacity


Generator Configuration:

Industrial facilities typically use multiple generators for redundancy
A common configuration might be 3 × 600 kW generators (1,800 kW total)
This allows for maintenance of one generator while maintaining full backup 
capacity



Therefore, Cool Port II would likely require approximately 1,700-1,800 kW of 
backup generator capacity, likely configured as multiple large diesel generators 
with automatic transfer switches, fuel storage for at least 48-72 hours of operation, 
and regular testing and maintenance protocols.
