    "\n",
    "Key improvements:\n",
    "1. Code is organized into separate modules with clear responsibilities\n",
    "2. Configuration values are externalized\n",
    "3. Error handling is consistent throughout the codebase\n",
    "4. File paths are handled properly\n",
    "5. Data validation is performed before processing\n",
    "6. Visualization code is more modular and reusable\n",
    "7. Documentation is comprehensive with docstrings following a consistent format"
